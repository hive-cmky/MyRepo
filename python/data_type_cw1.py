"""Lets look at some common data types found in programming problems for beginners

    Integers
        Integers are whole numbers that can be negative, zero or positive. Examples - 15, 0, -5

    Float
        A float will have a decimal place. Examples - 4.5, -2.778
        Note that 4.0, -2.0 are also floats

    Strings
        Strings are a group of characters. Examples - abcde, CodeChef, START69
        Note that strings can also contain numerical characters. Examples a1b2c3d4, 532

    Arrays / Lists
        Arrays or lists are used to store multiple variables or input types. Examples of arrays
            Array containing 6 integers - [1 , 5, 7, 10, 15, 2]
            Array containing 4 strings - ["abcd", "d", "ccc", "c123"]
            Array containing a combination of string and integers - ["abcd", 4, "ccc", 25]
        Note that the strings in the array were denoted as "abcd" - we will come to this at a later stage
