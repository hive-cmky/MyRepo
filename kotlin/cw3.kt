/*We can also perform mathematical operations with 'print'.
These use the familiar symbols of:

    + for addition
    − for subtraction
    ∗ for multiplication
    / for division

Try printing the sum of 21 and 40.

Notice that on the editor on the right, the instructions appear in gray color. This is because they are comments and don't affect the code. 
The way we write comments is by adding "//" before it. */

fun main(args : Array<String>){
    print(20 + 40)
}
