/*
Printing text
In the last problem, we saw how to output an integer (using print()).
Now let's see how to output some text.
There is only one difference. All textual content should start and end with double quotes.
For eg -

print("Hey")

Task

    Replace the _ (underscores) in the editor with the text "I love Kotlin" to output "I love Kotlin".
 */

 fun main(args : Array<String>){
    print("I love Kotlin")
 }
